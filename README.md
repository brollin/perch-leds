# Perch LEDs

A personal LED project. Enjoy :)

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico (CircuitPython firmware)
- WS2812B LEDs

## To do

- Rather than fade out, do an interpolation between last frame of last pattern and first frame of next pattern
- Allow composition, for instance allow fading out an animated pattern
